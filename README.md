# worldbuilding-notes
These are notes for my art stuff. Feel free to use this world as you please as long as I get credit for making it.

Just include a link to this repository, and you'll be all set in any creative works. (It includes the license used by my world).
**Note: ALL CHARACTERS used in stories with these links are not "official", but it still makes the world and lore feel alive and can be monitized as long as the other characters involved are your own. It can be canon to your arcs, but it will not be canon to the main story overall.**
